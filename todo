Done:
x Read file
x Print file out
x Break file into lines
x Tokenizing / Determining expression type
x Conditionals: If
x Mapping variables to registers
x Ignore:
    x comment lines (or copy them over?)
    x brace only lines
x Conditionals: Else
    x Case 1: Else on own line
    x Case 3: Else if

Todo:
- Loops
- Arithmetic
- Pipelining
- When do we unmap a variable?
- Copy over comments in assembly format
- Conditionals: Else
    - Case 2: Else on same line as closing bracket of if
- Conditionals: If
    - If only an if, we need to print a label after the body

Backlog:
- Arrays
- Functions
