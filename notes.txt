Problem: Parsing expressions after knowing expression type

Case 1: if statements
     - everything inside of { } belongs to if statement
     - read until '}'

Case 2: Loops
    - everything inside of { } belongs to Loops
    - read until '}'

Case 3: Arithemitc
    - line belongs to arithmetic
    - read line

Solutions:
    1. Requires more restructuring
         - read line, check expression type
         - class/function reads remaining lines (if necessary) and handles as needed
            ex.
                // remove the while(getline(...))
                getline(...)
                check_expression(tokens[0])
                if (ET_CONTROL)
                    handleControl() // reads input until '}'
    2. Requires less restructuring (BETTER)
        - read all lines into vector


bne r2, r1, ELSE
add r1, r3, r4

ELSE:
    add r2, r3, r4
